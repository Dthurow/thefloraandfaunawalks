Corylus cornuta, common name Beaked Hazelnut, has some hazelnuts on its branches! The common name is from the husk that surrounds the hazelnut itself, creating a prickly protection with a little "beak" on one side. They can be good, but unless you're fighting off the squirrels, you're unlikely to actually get the nuts when they've ripened.  #pnw #plants
