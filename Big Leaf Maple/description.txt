Acer macrophyllum, common name Big Leaf Maple. They're big. Bold. And covered in moss! If you want a real classic pacific northwest forest, you NEED big leaf maples. They're great covered in moss, and if you look close at the ones in the picture, you can see the remains of some Polypodium glycyrrhiza, common name licorice fern, poking out of the moss. A beautiful tree that I love! #plants #pnw
