Populus balsamifera, common name Black Cottonwood. Since I was walking around a small pond, it makes sense that the water-loving cottonwoods were quite happy there! They grow fast, in the tree world, anyway, and are a pioneer species, one of the first trees to populate a field or a clearcut area. Left to their own devices they can get up to 100 feet tall! #pnw #plants
