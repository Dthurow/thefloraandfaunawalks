I can finally start identifying plants by flowers again!!! This is Sanguinaria canadensis, bloodroot! Which has a pretty sweet genus name, if I do say so myself. It's called this because it has red sap, and is/was used as a natural red dye by multiple tribes around here, including Ojibwa and Cherokee, according to naeb.brit.org. It also spreads its seeds with the helps of ants, which I just feel is a really enjoyable way of spreading, honestly. #ethnobotany #minnesota #plants
