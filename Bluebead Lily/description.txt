Clintonia borealis, common name Bluebead Lily, found on the north shore of Lake Superior. Bluebead Lilies common name comes from the fruit, vibrantly blue berries, as you can see. The flower itself is yellow, so it seems regardless of the season, these plants are a nice contrast to the surrounding woods. #minnesota #plants #northshore #minnesotanativeplants
