Pteridium aquilinium, common name Bracken fern, has a contentious edibility history. Japan, China, and Korea all have a history of using the fiddleheads (the initial sprouted leaves before they uncurl) as a food for years. However, research has shown that it is carcinogenic and most wild edible books I see will list it as near unequivocally poisonous. As for me, I prefer to use it in a less contentious way. If you pull a single bracken up and strip some of the lower fronds, they work great as ad-hoc spears you can throw at your friends or older brother! #pnw #plants #ethnobotany
