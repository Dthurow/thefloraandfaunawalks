Cornus canadensis, common name Bunchberry, in its most eye-catching form (personal opinion). Found along the trail to Lake Agnes on the North Shore in Minnesota. Bunchberries are actually members of the Dogwood Family, which is mostly trees and shrubs. But Bunchberry is one of the exceptions, a rhizomatous perennial instead! Its roots grow horizontal and send up shoots, leading to large patches of the plant. The berries are edible too! Most books label them as "insipid", and they're certainly not the most exciting flavor in the world, but there's a mellow sweetness to it, and the berry itself is an odd almost-mealy texture that seems interesting. It doesn't beat out the other more popular berries for flavor, but the unique structure and colors of the bunchberry more than makes up for it. #minnesota #plants #ethnobotany
