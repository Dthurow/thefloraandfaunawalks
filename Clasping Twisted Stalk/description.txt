Streptopus amplexifolius, common name Clasping Twistedstalk provides a nice pop of color on the forest floor. A member of the lily family, it has the distinctive parallel veins in the leaves that show it's a monocot, and the individual berries along the stem differentiates it from other lily family lookalikes. #pnw #plants
