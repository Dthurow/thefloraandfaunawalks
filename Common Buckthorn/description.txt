Rhamnus cathartica, common name Common Buckthorn. It's a strikingly odd looking tree right now, with all the leaves gone but abundant berries even this late in the season, spread out not just on the ends but along the branches. I identified it both by the round black berries clustered around leaf axils (where the leaf joins the stem), and the spine at the tip of the twigs (which gives this tree its common name). It's an invasive that was imported from Europe in the late 1800s, and apparently even the animals out here are not fans, since the berries are still here. #plants #minnesota
