Celtis occidentalis, common name hackberry, adorned a street I found on a walk. I had recently gotten "Wild Berries & Fruits" by Terasa Marrone, so I immediately had to go out and identify something new. Common in urban areas because they're fast growing and resistant to storm damage, the berries are sweet and delicious according to Marrone. I was hesitant to try one without other verification, but after some internet research I believe this is a hackberry, so I'll have to go back and give it a try! #plants #minnesota
