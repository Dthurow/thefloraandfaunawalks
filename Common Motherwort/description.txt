Leonurus cardiaca, common name motherwort, made an appearance on my walk! I was wondering along looking at all the brown things on the ground and suddenly I saw a group of plants just off the trail with green leaves still! I had to investigate, and discovered it was some motherwort! It's weedy out here and escapes cultivation easily, but motherwort also has uses for soothing nervous tenxion and anxiety via tea or tinctures, and it's also supposed to help new mothers (hence the name). I'll have to remember where I found this and come back out in the spring for it! #plants #minnesota #ethnobotany
