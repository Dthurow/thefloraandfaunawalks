Eriocaulon aquaticum, common name Common Pipewort, was off of multiple islands in the boundary waters in minnesota. I was lucky to spot them the first time, they're quite small and unassuming. But when you look closer, they're weird! Flowers are tiny hard balls of white stuck on individual stems barely poking above the water. #plants #minnesota
