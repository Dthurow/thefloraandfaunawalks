Oplopanax horridus, common name Devil's club. I normally only see it farther up in the mountains, so I was surprised to see it on my walk! I love it mainly because of its great name (both the common and the scientific "horridus" name), but that's not the only reason it's interesting. Two of my main resource books list basically every part of the Devil's club as used by different tribes here. As medicine for rheumatism, colds, arthritis and ulcers,  fish hooks and lures, and as face paint. A do-everything plant with a thorny disposition! #pnw #plants #ethnobotany
