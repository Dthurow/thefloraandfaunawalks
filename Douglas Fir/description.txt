Pseudotsuga menziesii, common name douglas fir, has my favorite scientific name (try saying it out loud, it's great). This particular one had quite a large flow of sap down its side that I was curious about. I couldn't tell if there was a cut in the bark the whole way down or not. I know it's sap because I engaged in the age-old scientific research method, "poke it with a stick", and it seemed to be congealing sap. #pnw #plants
