Digitalis Purpurea, common name Foxglove. A beautiful flower, with a deadly secret (dun dun DUUUN). Foxglove contains the toxin digitalis, and if eaten in even a small amount, it can paralyze the heart! And it has all the not-pleasant side effects you can think of: nausea, diarrhea, tremors and convulsions, to name a few. But it turns out that toxin has an upside! SLIGHTLY paralysing the heart can be a great thing during heart failure, apparently, and the purified version of the toxin can be used in modern medicine! #pnw #plants #ethnobotany
