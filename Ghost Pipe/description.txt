Monotropa uniflora, common name Indian Pipe or Corpse Plant, is quite unique. See how white it is? Despite being a plant, it doesn't need chlorophyll to survive because it doesn't use the sun. Instead, it's parasitic, and sucks nutrients from the nearby trees! I love this plant cuz it's so funky looking, and on my walk today I found 9 different locations with it! One location had several little clusters all within a few feet of each other! #plants #pnw
