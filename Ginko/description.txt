Ginko biloba, common name ginkgo. It's twig identification season! Thankfully the fallen leaves are still visible, so I have some extra clues for now. Introduced in Minnesota 100-150 years ago, they're a relatively common tree in the city, and these were lining a street here in Minneapolis. The seeds inside the fruit is edible, though I don't think I've tried it before, and the leaves can be used as a tea. Something to keep an eye out next year! #plants #minnesota
