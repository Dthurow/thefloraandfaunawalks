Spiraea Douglasii, common name hardhack, is the only plant where I learned the scientific name only, and never learned the common name at all. It's a large shrub plant with spire-shaped pink flowers, so the genus made sense, and in the pacific northwest, every other plant and animal has douglas in its name, so the scientific name just makes sense! #pnw #plants
