Rubus discolor, common name Himalayan blackberry, is in full swing! Introduced from India via England, this blackberry has absolutely taken over a lot of the clearings and forest edges. I'm not a huge fan of the gigantic impenetrable bramble walls it makes, but man the blackberries on it are awfully good. And as a bonus, I don't have to worry about over harvesting! #plants #pnw
