Arisaema triphyllum, common name Jack-in-the-pulpit, found on the north shore of Lake Superior. When I first saw these I thought I'd found some absolutely huge Trilliums, but once you get close it's easy to see the difference. The "pulpit" bit of the Jack-in-the-pulpit is gone, leaving an odd looking fruit cluster behind. Apparently the corm (swollen part of the plant stem underground), can be eaten if carefully prepared. Proper preparation is required to neutralize the calcium oxalate crystals in the corm, which causes intense burning sensation in your mouth otherwise. Personally, I think I'll leave well enough alone. #minnesota #plants #northshore #minnesotanativeplants
