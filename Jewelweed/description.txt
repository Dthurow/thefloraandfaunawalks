Impatiens capensis, common name Jewelweed, found on the north shore of Lake Superior. This plant has a striking and I think rather pretty flower. It's in the touch-me-not family, which means if you touch the seed pods, they explode in your face! Luckily I avoided such a terrible fate and just got some pictures instead. The stem and leaves also apparently work as an antidote to stinging nettle, poison ivy, and helps with bug bites. A good plant to remember! #minnesota #plants #northshore #minnesotanativeplants
