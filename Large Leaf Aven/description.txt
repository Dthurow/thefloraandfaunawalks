Geum macrophyllum, common name large-leaf aven, is blooming. It's a common sight in northern Washington, but not as much down by Olympia, so it was one of the first new plants I learned when I moved up here. This plant, along with Tellima grandiflora (fringecup), fill the edges of most trails around here. #pnw #plants
