Trillium cernuum, common name Nodding Trillium, found on the north shore of Lake Superior. I'm visiting the north shore and the boundary waters, so there'll be more Minnesotan plants! Trillium cernuum has the flower droop down below the leaves. It's late enough in the season that it's now bearing the fruit from the flower, something I haven't seen before. There's also a Trillium flexipes, common name drooping trillium, in Minnesota, but from what I've read, the range for the drooping trillium is much smaller. #minnesota #plants #northshore #minnesotanativeplants
