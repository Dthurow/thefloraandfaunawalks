Acraspis erinacei, hedgehog gall wasps, made an appearance on my walk recently. A weird thing about these wasps is their reproduction cycle. In one generation they have both male and female wasps. This is the generation that creates these galls along the veins of white oaks. The larvea that hatch out from these galls are all female, the second generation. These will eventually lay eggs in the buds of the white oak, which will hatch male and female, starting the cycle over again. Why do they do this? The internet doesn't say. 
On the plus side, the internet says the galls don't really hurt the trees, since the wasps are so dependent on the white oaks, they don't quite harm the tree. Which is good, because there were two trees here that were absolutely covered! #minnesota #plants
