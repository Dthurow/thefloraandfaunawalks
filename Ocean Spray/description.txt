Holodiscus discolor, common name Ocean Spray or Ironwood, is in full spray-form right now. Not only pretty to look at, the wood itself is insanely strong (hence the name "ironwood"), it's great for making arrows if you can find a straight length long enough for it. I've always wanted to use it for that, but since I don't really NEED to, I just can't bring myself to cut down such a pretty plant! #plants #pnw
