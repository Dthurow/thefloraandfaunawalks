Mahonia aquifolium, common name Oregon Grape is starting to fruit and ripen. It's a very tart berry, but definitely edible. I've heard that you can make a tasty jam if you use both Oregon Grape and Salal (Gaultheria shallon) together, but I've never had the gumption to collect enough to try. The young leaves, before they harden into their leathery and spikey versions, can actually be chewed on, and give off a lemony flavor. #pnw #plants #ethnobotany
