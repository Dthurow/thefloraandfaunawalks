Oyster mushrooms! ...I think. I'm still learning my mushrooms, but the gills, shape, and growing location points to oysters. If they are real oyster mushrooms, they're a tasty addition to any meal! Or, maybe these are some deadly look-a-like. So take this identification with a grain of salt (and if I'm right, butter too).  #pnw #mushrooms
