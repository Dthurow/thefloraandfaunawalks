Anaphalis margaritacea, common name Pearly Everlasting, found on islands in lake Insula in the boundary waters of Minnesota. Beautiful round ball-like flowers, they were in multiple locations through lake Insula. The common name comes from the flowers lasting power, and its used in dried  arrangements because of it! #minnesota #plants
