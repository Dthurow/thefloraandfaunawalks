Sambucus racemosa, common name Red Elderberry, is a common site in western washington. Not as popular as the black elderberry seen in syrups in the medicine aisle, Red Elderberry has a long history of use by multiple Native American tribes in this area, and the elderberries themselves can be eaten while cooked, and the bark and leaves have been used for medicine. Though I personally just rather like how they look! #plants #pnw #ethnobotany
