Vaccinium parvifolium, common name Red Huckleberry is probably my favorite berry out here. When I was little, my brother and I used to compete to see who could eat the most of the tart berries (a game with no winners, honestly), and that's always left me with a nostalgic fondness for it. The huckleberries are loaded on this hike, and I had to have a handful on my walk! #pnw #plants
