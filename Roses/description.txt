Some roses (genus Rosa), with some huge rosehips ready to be turned into tea 😁. The size of the plant and the rosehips implies it's not a native rose to me, but I'm not sure which type it is. Regardless, the rosehips can be harvested and dried, then used in tea! Rosehips are a source of vitamin C, and make a great tea or syrup to brighten the winter months. #pnw #plants #ethnobotany #edibleplants
