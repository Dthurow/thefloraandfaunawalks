Gaultheria shallon, common name Salal, is starting to fruit as well! It's more sweet than the similar looking Oregon Grape (Mahonia aquifolium), but the texture is kind of hairy and weird, to be honest. I've heard that you can make a tasty jam if you use both Oregon Grape (Mahonia aquifolium) and Salal together, but I've never had the gumption to collect enough to try. #pnw #plants #ethnobotany
