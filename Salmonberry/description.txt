Rubus spectabilis, common name Salmonberry, is a common sight out here, and a member of the rubus genus, the same family as raspberries and blackberries! Their flavor is more variable than commercial varieties, so some are very flavorful and some are pretty bland. Which means the only way to be sure is to eat all the ripe ones you can find! :P #pnw #plants
