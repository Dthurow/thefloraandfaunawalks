Onoclea sensibilis, common name Sensitive Fern, found on the north shore of Lake Superior. I was happy to find ferns are also out here, though I can't seem to find a single Polystichum munitum, common name sword fern, on the forest floor, which is a weird experience. This fern is sensitive to cold (so it's weird it's in northern Minnesota), hence the common name, and it has a large spike with the spores that shoot up amidst the fronds. Altogether an odd plant! #minnesota #plants #northshore #minnesotanativeplants
