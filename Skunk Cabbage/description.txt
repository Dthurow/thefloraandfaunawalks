Symplocarpus foetidus, common name Skunk Cabbage! I was seeing pictures people have been posting of these skunk cabbages, and was confused, because they didn't look like the Skunk Cabbage I was familiar with in the pacific northwest. Turns out because it's a different species (PNW has Lysichiton americanus skunk cabbage. The internet says the common name for it is WESTERN skunk cabbage, but I never heard it called that). Symplocarpus foetidus is the variety that actually heats the ground around it, to allow it to grow earlier in the year, even through snow. WHICH IS SO COOL AND WEIRD!! They're thermogenic (heat-creating) as part of a secondary process while converting oxygen to usable energy. WHY ARE PLANTS MAKING HEAT THAT'S SO WEIRD I LOVE IT. Also their flowers are weird as heck, I got a couple close ups so you can see. #minnesota #plants
