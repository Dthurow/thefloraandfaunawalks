Tilia cordata, common name Small-leaved Linden, is all over on my walks. They're identifiable as the Tilia genus by the distinctive leaf-like bract that supports the flowers (now transformed into the nut-like fruit). How did I tell the specific species with no leaves or flowers? Years of experience! Also, Minneapolis Park Board has released their plant survey and it was incorporated into fallingfruit.org, so I could see the exact location/species of all the public trees in minneapolis! The small-leaved linden has tons of uses, too! The flowers can be dried to make a honey and jasmine-like tea, and the young leaves themselves are edible! (which seems weird, but I def want to try it) #plants #ethnobotany
