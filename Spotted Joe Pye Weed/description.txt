Eutrochium maculatum, common name Spotted Joe-pye weed, found on the north shore of Lake Superior. Some beautiful and funky flowers here, I had to get closer when I saw it on a gravel bar of the Caribou river. Besides a cool flower, it's also a good nectar source for butterflies of all sorts, including monarchs! #minnesota #plants #northshore #minnesotanativeplants
