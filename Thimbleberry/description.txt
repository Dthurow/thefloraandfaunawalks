Rubus parviflorus, common name Thimbleberries are some of my favorite wild berries out here! They have lots of seeds, so rather than crunching down on a berry, try mashing it with your tongue. Saves you seeds getting permanently stuck in your teeth ðŸ˜… They're super tasty and quite soft when ripe, and thimbleberry jam is delicious! It can take a while to collect enough ripe berries to make jam though, since every animal seems to love them too. #plants #pnw #edibleplants
