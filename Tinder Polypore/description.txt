Fomes fomentarius, common name Tinder Polypore or Hoof Fungus, found on a hike to Agnes Lake. It's very common, though I hadn't spotted it before, and true to its common name, looks like a weird hoof. It was off the trail enough I couldn't grab some to test the other common name's validity for myself. However, its been used for over 5300 years as a firestarter, and there's even proof! It was found in the leather pouch of the prehistoric "Ice Man Ã–tzi" (who was found frozen in a glacier in the Alps), soaked in a saltpeter solution to be used as a firestarter. Super cool! #plants #minnesota #ethnobotany
