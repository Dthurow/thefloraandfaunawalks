Thuja plicata, common name Western Red Cedar, is absolutely everywhere here in western washington. This one is unique because you can see the unique scar left by someone harvesting the bark! Cedar bark can be processed by hand to become practically everything you need: Clothing, rope, towels, plates, mats, everything! A standard way to harvest is to cut a line low down on a tree, then gradually pull down and out to pull off huge strips of bark all in one go. This has to be done carefully to get the most bark you can, and only on trees large enough to handle the loss of bark, otherwise, you'll kill the tree. This one seems to be healing though :) #plants #pnw #ethnobotany
