Rabbit! I didn't get close enough to positively identify it beyond "wild rabbit". In Washington state, it looks like it's either Sylvilagus nuttallii, common name Nuttal's cottontail, a native rabbit species out here. Or Sylvilagus floridanus, common name Eastern cottontail, a species introduced in the 1930s.#pnw #animalsofpnw
