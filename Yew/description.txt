Taxus canadensis, common name canadian yew is a native shrub out here. Though since I found this as a decorative shrub next to a store, it actually may be a different variety. Regardless, it's definitely a yew. Yews are known as THE wood for making archery bows. The wood is often twisted though, so it can be tough to find a piece straight enough for one. The entire plant is also VERY toxic. Though according to wikipedia, the red "fruit" part of the yew is actually very sweet! But if you eat any seeds in the fruit, you can die from cardiac arrest or respiratory failure, plus there's no known antidote to yew poisoning. Sooo, maybe leave this one for the birds ðŸ˜… #plants #minnesota #ethnobotany
