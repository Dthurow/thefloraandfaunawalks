First off, Wild Sarsaparilla is completely different than Sarsaparilla. They're in entirely different Orders, even! Wild Sarsaparilla is in genus Aralia, while true Sarsaparilla is in the Smilax genus. One is a tropical climbing plant, while the other is a low-growing plant found in North America. In fact, Wild Sarsaparilla is much more closely related to ginseng than true Sarsaparilla (it's at least in the same family as ginseng). The common name implies it was used for making root beer or sarsaparilla soda, so I started researching online and after an hour and a half, still don't know for sure if/how it was used. The websites I've found all agree it was used as a substitute in root beer, but they don't agree if it was substituting sassafras or sarsaparilla. I also didn't find any recipes that used Wild Sarsaparilla specifically. One article says traditional american recipes would sometimes refer to sarsaparilla in their recipes and mean Wild Sarsaparilla, but didn't explain how we could know that. Another website references Rosemary Gladstar’s "Medicinal Herbs" book and copies out a root beer tea recipe, at least. But the recipe itself only says sarsaparilla, not WILD sarsaparilla. So I ordered the book at the library to find out more... #minnesota #plants #ethnobotany             </div>         </div>     </div>         <script>         var slideIndex = 1;         showDivs(slideIndex);         function plusDivs(n)         {             showDivs(slideIndex += n);         }         function showDivs(n)         {             var i;             var x = document.getElementsByClassName("PlantImage");             if (n > x.length) { slideIndex = 1 }             if (n < 1) { slideIndex = x.length };             for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++)             {                 x[i].style.display = "none";             }             x[slideIndex - 1].style.display = "block";         }     </script> </body> <footer>     <div>         The Flora and Fauna walk's description, pictures, and code were created by <a href="https://daniellethurow.com" target="_blank">Danielle Thurow</a>     </div> </footer> </html>
